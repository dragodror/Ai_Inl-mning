prompt 1:   Can you make a small utility program with automatic booked operations on this 
            computer in javascript

            /*
            const schedule = require('node-schedule');
            const fs = require('fs');

            // Function to perform the booked operation
            function bookedOperation() {
                const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
                fs.appendFile('log.txt', `Booked operation executed at ${timestamp}\n`, (err) => {
                    if (err) throw err;
                    console.log(`Booked operation executed at ${timestamp}`);
                });
            }

            // Schedule the booked operation to run every minute
            const job = schedule.scheduleJob('* * * * *', bookedOperation);

            console.log('Scheduled booked operation to run every minute.');
