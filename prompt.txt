prompt 1:   Can you make a small utility program with automatic booked operations on this 
            computer in javascript

            /*
            const schedule = require('node-schedule');
            const fs = require('fs');

            // Function to perform the booked operation
            function bookedOperation() {
                const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
                fs.appendFile('log.txt', `Booked operation executed at ${timestamp}\n`, (err) => {
                    if (err) throw err;
                    console.log(`Booked operation executed at ${timestamp}`);
                });
            }

            // Schedule the booked operation to run every minute
            const job = schedule.scheduleJob('* * * * *', bookedOperation);

            console.log('Scheduled booked operation to run every minute.');
            */

prompt 2:   make it so that my job creates a text file every time

// Function to perform the booked operation, promt 1, updated promt 2
function bookedOperation() {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const filename = `log_${timestamp.replace(/[:.]/g, '-')}.txt`; // Replace colons and dots to make it a valid filename
    const content = `Booked operation executed at ${timestamp}\n`;

    fs.writeFile(filename, content, (err) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(`Booked operation executed and logged in ${filename}`);
    });
}
